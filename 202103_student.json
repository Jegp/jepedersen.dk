This is actually not trivial. How would you know what is <i>interesting</i>? \nWhat, exactly, are interesting questions?\nWell, unfortunately, no one knows. This a large part of why science is\nhard. Your best bet, I think, is to go where your common sense takes you: think \nabout what you&#39;ve already learned (which is a lot) and ask the necessary questions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Falsifiability is a tremendously\nimportant part of any science. If you do not know what it is, please read \nthis <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability\">Wikipedia article now</a>. \nI&#39;ll give you one <em>good</em> and one <em>bad</em> example of science. Can you guess\nwhich one is which? One example is trivially impossible to test (with current)\ntechnology. The other is a concrete and testable statement that you can\nmeasure. The answer may be no. But with enough work, you can build on \nthe present state of science to offer an answer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hypothesis: Global warming is the will of god.</li>\n<li>Hypothesis: Global warming is caused by rising levels of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi><msub><mi>O</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">CO_2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">C</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">O</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3011em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0278em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">â€‹</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"writing\">Writing</h3>\n<p>Writing is an important discipline and <strong>skill</strong> you need to acquire. \nWriting will help you not just convey your ideas to the examiner, but is a\ncrucial tool for thinking. \nAnd as you know, it takes a serious amount of time to develop a skill, so\nstart early and practice often.</p>\n<p>KTH offers help with academic writing. \nI strongly suggest you take at least one of their courses. \n<a href=\"https://www.kth.se/en/biblioteket//skriva-referera/skrivande-retorik/centrum-for-akademiskt-skrivande-retorik-1.856488\">https://www.kth.se/en/biblioteket</a></p>\n"}
