My research **focuses on the fascinating world of spatiotemporal computation for brain-inspired systems**.
I explore how we can harness the power of nervous systems for processing information in both space and time towards more efficient and intelligent computational systems.
I have contributed to developing the [Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation (NIR)](https://neuroir.org), a standardized framework aimed at bridging the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
Additionally, I have developed geometric methods for [neuromorphic and spatiotemporal receptive fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00318), and I am the creator of several popular open-source tools, including [Norse](https://github.com/norse/norse), a library for spiking neural networks in PyTorch, and [Faery](https://github.com/aestream/faery), which focuses on event data processing and recording.

If you're interested in diving deeper into my research, you can find a comprehensive list of my publications on my [Semantic Scholar profile](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Jens-Egholm-Pedersen/2146807252).

In the face of the complexity and unpredictability of the real world, many contemporary algorithms fall short, often failing spectacularly. 
**I believe there is an urgent need for self-correcting, closed-loop systems that can better solve our everyday physical challenges**.
This drives my passion for creating technologies that can autonomously adapt, learn, and perform meaningful work.

Simultaneously, I learned how underrepresented neuromorphic computing is in the broader AI community - and to society at large.
My work has been featured in large journals, I am a frequent speaker at international conferences and workshops, and have been interviewed by magazines and podcasts.
