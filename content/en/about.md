Jens Egholm Pedersen is a doctoral student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology working to model and construct neuromorphic control systems.
His research explores the intersection of neuroscience and computer science, developing brain-inspired computing systems that process information with remarkable efficiency and adaptability.

## Research Focus
Jens's research centers on a fundamental question: What is intelligence, and how can we replicate it in computational systems? His work in neuromorphic computing seeks to understand and mimic the brain's extraordinary ability to process information, learn, and adapt in real-time.
His journey began with modeling learning systems using both spiking and artificial neural networks. This early fascination with neural mechanisms led to his current focus on developing computational frameworks for brain-inspired computing. A key contribution is "The Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation," which provides a common language bridging neuroscience and artificial intelligence. This framework is now used across more than 12 neuromorphic software and hardware projects.
Jens has developed several influential tools in the field, including "AEStream," and the successor "Faery", both high-performance libraries for streaming event-based data processing, and "Norse," a deep learning library specifically designed for spiking neural networks.
These tools enable more efficient AI systems that closely mimic human cognitive functions.

## Collaborative Work and Recognition
Throughout his career, Jens has collaborated with leading researchers in neuromorphic computing and participated in prestigious international workshops such as [Telluride](https://sites.google.com/view/telluride-2025/) and [CapoCaccia](https://capocaccia.cc/en/), as well as conferences including [NICE](https://niceworkshop.org/) and [ICONS](https://iconsneuromorphic.cc/). His contributions have earned significant recognition, including the Mahowald Early Career Award, a prestigious postdoctoral scholarship grant from the Wallenberg Foundation, and the NSF AccelNet NeuroPAC grant.
He was elected the chair of the [Open-Neuromorphic computing community](https://open-neuromorphic.org/) in 2025, which emphasizes his commitment to advancing the field of neuromorphic computing and fostering collaboration among researchers.

## Vision and Philosophy
By simulating, analyzing, and understanding neural circuits involved in vision, motor control, and self-sustenance, Jens aims to develop autonomous systems that are both intelligent and robust in dynamic environments. His approach is guided by Richard Feynman's principle: "What I cannot create, I do not understand." He believes that to truly comprehend intelligence, we must endeavor to create it through computational models that capture the essence of biological neural systems.

## Research

At the heart of my research lies a profound curiosity: What is intelligence, really? As a PhD candidate at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, my work seeks to unravel the mysteries of neuromorphic computing, an innovative field that blends neuroscience and computer science. My research aims to mimic the brain’s extraordinary ability to process information with unparalleled efficiency and adaptability. I believe that by understanding the core principles of intelligence in biological systems, we can revolutionize how we approach computation, learning, and ultimately, how we interact with technology.

My journey began in the realms of computer science and cognition, where I delved into how learning systems can be modeled using both spiking and artificial neural networks. My early fascination with the brain's mechanisms has driven me to explore how its complex processes can be replicated in computational models. This led to my current research, where I work on developing computational frameworks for brain-inspired computing. One of my key projects, "The Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation," provides a common language that bridge the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence, and is used across more than 12 neuromorphic software and hardware projects.

## Awards and Recognition

I have been honored with several awards that recognize my contributions to the field, including the  NSF AccelNet NeuroPAC Fellowship, which supports my research in neuromorphic computing, and the Edge of Government Award for my innovative work in applying neuromorphic principles to real-world problems. These accolades reflect not only my commitment to advancing our understanding of intelligence but also my dedication to making this knowledge accessible and applicable across various domains.

## Motivation

My motivation stems from a desire to push the boundaries of what machines can do, not just in terms of raw processing power but in their capacity to learn, adapt, and make sense of the world in real-time. This vision has led to my involvement in several groundbreaking projects, including the development of "AEStream," a high-performance library for event-based data processing, and "Norse," a deep learning library tailored for spiking neural networks. These tools are designed to empower the next generation of AI systems, making them more efficient and closer to mimicking human cognitive functions.

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of collaborating with some of the brightest minds in the field, from leading neuromorphic computing experts to interdisciplinary teams at international workshops, like Telluride and CapoCaccia, and conferences, like NICE and ICONS. My contributions have been recognized with honors such as the NSF AccelNet NeuroPAC Fellowship and the Edge of Government Award. 
By simulating, analyzing, and understanding neural circuits involved in vision, motor control, and self-sustenance, I aim to develop autonomous systems that are not only intelligent but also robust in dynamic environments. My work is deeply inspired by Richard Feynman’s axiom: *"What I cannot create, I do not understand."* To truly understand intelligence, I believe we must endeavor to create it.
