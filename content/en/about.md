Jens Egholm Pedersen is a doctoral student at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) working to model and construct [neuromorphic control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering).

    
## Research

At the heart of my research lies a profound curiosity: What is intelligence, really? As a PhD candidate at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, my work seeks to unravel the mysteries of neuromorphic computing, an innovative field that blends neuroscience and computer science. My research aims to mimic the brain’s extraordinary ability to process information with unparalleled efficiency and adaptability. I believe that by understanding the core principles of intelligence in biological systems, we can revolutionize how we approach computation, learning, and ultimately, how we interact with technology.

My journey began in the realms of computer science and cognition, where I delved into how learning systems can be modeled using both spiking and artificial neural networks. My early fascination with the brain's mechanisms has driven me to explore how its complex processes can be replicated in computational models. This led to my current research, where I work on developing computational frameworks for brain-inspired computing. One of my key projects, "The Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation," provides a common language that bridge the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence, and is used across more than 12 neuromorphic software and hardware projects.

## Motivation

My motivation stems from a desire to push the boundaries of what machines can do, not just in terms of raw processing power but in their capacity to learn, adapt, and make sense of the world in real-time. This vision has led to my involvement in several groundbreaking projects, including the development of "AEStream," a high-performance library for event-based data processing, and "Norse," a deep learning library tailored for spiking neural networks. These tools are designed to empower the next generation of AI systems, making them more efficient and closer to mimicking human cognitive functions.

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of collaborating with some of the brightest minds in the field, from leading neuromorphic computing experts to interdisciplinary teams at international workshops, like Telluride and CapoCaccia, and conferences, like NICE and ICONS. My contributions have been recognized with honors such as the NSF AccelNet NeuroPAC Fellowship and the Edge of Government Award. 
By simulating, analyzing, and understanding neural circuits involved in vision, motor control, and self-sustenance, I aim to develop autonomous systems that are not only intelligent but also robust in dynamic environments. My work is deeply inspired by Richard Feynman’s axiom: *"What I cannot create, I do not understand."* To truly understand intelligence, I believe we must endeavor to create it.
