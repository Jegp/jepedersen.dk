Jens Egholm Pedersen is a doctoral student at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) working to model and construct [neuromorphic control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering).

## Research

Jens' research centers on questions around spatiotemporal computation for sparse and neuromorphic systems.
He worked on [Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation](https://neuroir.org), developed geometric methods for [neuromorphic and spatiotemporal receptive fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00318), and has published popular open-source tools like [Norse](https://github.com/norse/norse) and [Faery](https://github.com/aestream/faery), among other things.

A list of his publications can be found on his [Semantic Scholar profile](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Jens-Egholm-Pedersen/2146807252).

## Personal motivation

When faced with the complexity and ambiguity in the real world, contemporary algorithms fail spectacularly. There is a **strong need for self-correcting, closed-loop systems to help solve our everyday physical problems**.

By simulating and carefully scrutinizing and understanding neural circuits, including vision, motor control, and self-sustenance, Jens seeks to build autonomous systems that perform meaningful work, tightly following the Feynman axiom *"What I cannot create, I do not understand"*.
