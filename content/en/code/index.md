Jens Egholm Pedersen is a doctoral student at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) working to model and construct [neuromorphic control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering).

When faced with the complexity and ambiguity in the real world, contemporary algorithms fail spectacularly. There is a **strong need for self-correcting, closed-loop systems to help solve our everyday physical problems**.

By simulating and carefully scrutinizing and understanding neural circuits, including vision, motor control, and self-sustenance, Jens seeks to build autonomous systems that perform meaningful work, tightly following the Feynman axiom *"What I cannot create, I do not understand"*.
