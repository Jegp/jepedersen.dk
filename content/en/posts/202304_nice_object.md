We published a paper on [Translation and Scale Invariance for Event-Based Object tracking](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3584954.3584996) for the Neuro-Inspired Computational Elements Conference (NICE) held in San Antonio, Texas. 

The paper contributes
1. Spiking neural networks **rivals** artificial neural networks when operating on event-based data
2. A **differentiable** method to convert spikes into coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^2$
3. **Real-time** object tracking with event-based vision on graphical processing units (GPUs)
