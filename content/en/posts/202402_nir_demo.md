Together with three of co-authors of the [NIR paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14641), Jason Eshragian, Bernhard Vogginger, and Felix Bauer, we published a hands-on tutorial of the Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation (NIR) on YouTube.
We first outline and motivate NIR in a historical context and explain why NIR offers one solution to the problem of interoperability between neuromorphic hardware and software.
Felix, Bernhard and I then demonstrate how to use NIR in practice, and Jason concludes with a discussion of the future of NIR and its potential impact on the neuromorphic community.
