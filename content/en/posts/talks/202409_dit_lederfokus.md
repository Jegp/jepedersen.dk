I was invited to talk at a conference for leading IT managers in Denmark, [Dansk IT Lederfokus](https://www.dit.dk/lederfokus/). I discussed the future of AI and neuromorphic computing, and how these technologies can be used to solve real-world problems.

The presentation was not recorded, but the [slideshow can be found here](/slides/2409_DIT/index.html).
