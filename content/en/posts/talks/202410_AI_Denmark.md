[Anders HÃ¸eg Nissen](https://ahnissen.dk/) interviewed me for the [AI Denmark podcast](https://aidenmark.dk/podcast) where we had great fun discussing neuromorphic computing and how the technology can help AI.
Anders asked some profound and poignant questions that really made me think. I hope you enjoy the episode as much as I did!
