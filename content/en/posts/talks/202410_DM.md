I was invited to give a webinar at the academic labour union for academic professionals in Denmark, [DM](https://www.dm.h/). I presented the high-level concept of neuromorphic computing, which technologies exist today, and how it can be used to solve real-world problems.

The presentation was not recorded, but the [slideshow can be found here](/slides/2410_DM/index.html).
