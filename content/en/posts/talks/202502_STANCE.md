I was invited to talk about neuromorphic computing from first principles at the Stategic Alliance for Neuromorphic Computing and Engineering (STANCE), organized by the [Frauenhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics](https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/hpc/data-analysis-and-machine-learning/neuromorphic-computing-alliance-stance-en.html).
In the talk, I give an overview of computational definitions for digital, analog, and neuromorphic hardware. I motivate NIR, present some existing open-source efforts in the community, and discuss potential directions in the future.

The presentation was not recorded, but the [slideshow can be found here](/slides/2502_STANCE/).
