I was invited to talk about neuromorphic computing at the Faroese tech festival, [Tonik](https://www.tonik.fo/).
Tonik is a fantastic mix of tech, business, and art and I thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the driven and creative minds there!

The talk is popular-scientific in nature: I give negative and positive motivations (sticks and carrots) for researching and applying neuromorphics.
And I talk about technology that is available *today*. Of course, I can't help but talk a bit about research in the end. Particular in relation to the [Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation](https://neuroir.org).

The presentation was not recorded, but the [slideshow can be found here](/slides/2505_Tonik/).
