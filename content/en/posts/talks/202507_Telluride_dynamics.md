I was invited to talk about dynamical systems for control at the [Telluride neuromorphic cognition engineering workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/telluride-2025/).
It was a tremendous pleasure and honor to talk at the workshop with a ridiculously cool line-up from world-leading researchers.

Slides [are available here](/slides/2507_Telluride/) and a recording can be provided upon request.
