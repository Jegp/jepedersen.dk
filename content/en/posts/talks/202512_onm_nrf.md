I was invited to give student talk on at the [Open Neuromorphic student talk](https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/student-talks/) about [spiking neural receptive fields](https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/student-talks/spiking-neural-receptive-fields/).
My talk expands on our work on spatio-temporal covariance for leaky integrators and leaky integrate-and-fire neurons [published at Nature Communications in 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63493-0).
I motivated the problem about neuromorphic computing, talked about the necessity for covariance guarantees, and discussed outlook and next steps.
