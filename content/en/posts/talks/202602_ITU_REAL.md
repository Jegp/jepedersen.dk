A talk for the [REAL group](https://real.itu.dk/) (Robotics, Evolution and Artificial Life) at the IT University of Copenhagen on event-driven sensing and neuromorphic computation for embodied intelligence.

The talk covers three themes: (1) the case for neuromorphic computing, motivated by the energy efficiency and speed of event cameras and neuromorphic hardware, (2) mathematical foundations for spiking neural networks, including our work on [spatio-temporal covariant receptive fields](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63493-0) and [scale-covariant spiking wavelets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02020), and (3) the convergence of event-driven sensing, neuromorphic compute, and embodied agents toward physical AI.

Slides [are available here](/slides/2602_ITU_REAL).
