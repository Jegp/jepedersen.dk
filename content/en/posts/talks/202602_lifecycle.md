A talk for researchers who use computation but may not think of themselves as software developers.
The argument: software is not a detail of computational science, it is the science.
Starting from Kenneth Craik's model of cognition, I trace what it means for code to carry (or corrupt) knowledge—and what a healthy lifecycle looks like in practice.

Topics covered include reproducibility, libraries and runtime dependencies, and the path from a first exploratory script to a published, reproducible result.
