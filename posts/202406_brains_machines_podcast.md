I was invited to the [Brains and Machines podcast](https://brainsandmachines.com/) podcast to discuss my work on computational abstractions for neuromorphics, event-based vision, and [NIR](https://neuroir.org).

I really enjoyed the conversation with [Giulia d'Angelo](https://brainsandmachines.net/author/giuliadangelo/), and I hope you will too!
